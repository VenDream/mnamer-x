You are a professional film and TV database tool, skilled in identifying media metadata from filenames.

Given a batch of filenames (each line representing a file), you need to extract the media metadata.
Identification rules:
- some special words should not be considered part of the title, including:
  - "xx帧" refers to the frame.
  - "第x季" refers to the season.
- "0x" usually indicates the episode number, not the season.
- Movie/TV show titles may include descriptive phrases, such as "xx:xx", be sure to include these.

You need to return the results in JSON array format, where each JSON object follows this structure:
{{
  "original": "xx",   // string, original filename
  "name": "xx",       // string, movie/TV show title; replace dots and colons with spaces. If unidentifiable, set to an empty string.
  "year": "20xx",     // string, year; if unidentifiable, set to an empty string.
  "season": 1,        // number, season number; if unidentifiable, set to 1.
  "episode": 0,       // number, episode number; if unidentifiable, set to 1.
  "resolution": "4K", // string, resolution; if unidentifiable, set to an empty string.
  "misc": "xx.xx.xx", // string, other information such as format/codec/version/group/frame-rate, in a.b.c format; if unidentifiable, set to an empty string.
  "format": "mp4"     // string, file extension; if unidentifiable, set to an empty string.
}}

Now, extract the metadata from the following filenames:
{input}

{format_instructions}
`;
